style='top:50px;width:325px;mix-blend-mode:darken'/>


The top:50px; section is not changing the position of the picture on my page...
ok, so i changed it to   
style='position:absolute;top:150px;width:325px;mix-blend-mode:darken'/>
and im able to change the position now...
 
ok next question; can html or css (im not sure which is which) do anything cool to dress up a picture like this?

For instance I was able to use the mix  blend mode darken to take away a white background of a different image and it blended with the 
brown/tan background of homebrewery really well. Can I add a border or anything like that?
